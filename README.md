# IBM-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the final projects completed as part of the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certification.

Included Projects:

**Part 3: Supervised Machine Learning - Regression**
This section focuses on implementing various regression techniques to predict continuous outcomes. Key methodologies include linear regression, polynomial regression, and regularization techniques such as ridge and lasso regression.

**Part 4: Unsupervised Machine Learning**
In this section, we explore clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. Projects include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to uncover patterns and groupings in unlabeled data.

**Part 5: Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning**
This part covers the basics and applications of deep learning and reinforcement learning. Projects include building neural networks with TensorFlow/Keras, implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification, and using reinforcement learning algorithms to solve complex problems.

**Part 6: Time Series and Survival Analysis**
In this section, we delve into time series forecasting and survival analysis. Key topics include ARIMA models, exponential smoothing, the Cox proportional hazards model, and the Kaplan-Meier estimator, applied to real-world datasets.
